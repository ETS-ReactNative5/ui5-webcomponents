    fix(ui5-shellbar): fix overlapping of the search box over icons (#2155)
    
    Now, when there is not enough space for the search field it is expanded to full width within the ui5-shellbar
    and the search filed does not overlap any other elements in the ui5-shellbar any more.
    
    FIXES: #2044
