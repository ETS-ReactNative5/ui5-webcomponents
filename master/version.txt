    refactor(ui5-title): remove custom css variables (#4885)
    
    The `ui5-title` used custom `ui5-` css variables for displaying the font size. As they are consistent in all themes I removed the custom variables which makes it more intuitive to modify the title font sizes via SAP Theme Designer.
