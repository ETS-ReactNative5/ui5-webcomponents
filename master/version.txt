    The following changes would affect the ui5-date-picker, ui5-daterange-picker and ui5-datetime-picker components:
    - The combobox role is now removed from the inner input field for compliance with the accessibility specification.
    - The aria-haspopup attribute value is updated to "grid" instead of "true".
