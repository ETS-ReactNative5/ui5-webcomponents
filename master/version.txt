    refactor(ui5-shellbar-item): rename "item-click" to "click" (#4282)
    
    Change event name from "item-click" to "click" as it belongs to the ShellBarItem, not the ShellBar and using "item" in the event's name does not make sense and this is also the rule we used throughout the major API change activity in RC.15.
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: ShellBarItem's event "item-click" has been renamed to "click".
