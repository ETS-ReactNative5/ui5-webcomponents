    chore: remove hardcoded CSS params (#4940)
    
    These files have been introduced previously within the "src" folder, because the SAP Horizon params were not available in theming-base-content. Now they are obsolete as the latest theming-base-content release includes them, the build also does not process them - it copies the params from node_modules.
