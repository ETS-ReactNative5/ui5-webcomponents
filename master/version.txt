    fix(ui5-li-tree): fixed incorrect display of the text (#3036)
    
    While the TreeListItem is in its _minimal state (with no visible
    text), the text was still taking space, causing incorrect alignment
    of the icons. Now the text is not rendered when we are in _minimal state
    which results in proper alignment of the icons.
