    fix(framework): fix scoping of self tag (#4952)
    
    However, there is one use-case when the Input web components uses `ui5-input` inside the InputPopoverTemplate.
    The solution in this PR is to consider component's own tag and add it to the list of tags subject to scoping, unless the tag is not explicitly excluded via configuration. This seems to be an edge case, so if alternative solution comes to mind, feel free to share it with me.
