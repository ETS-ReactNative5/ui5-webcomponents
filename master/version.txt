    feat(ui5-combobox): add full keyboard handling (#4494)
    
    The keyboard specification for the ComboBox is now fully implemented, with the addition of the following keys:
    
    - `F4`, `ALT`+`UP`/`DOWN`- Toggles the picker.
    - `PAGEDOWN` - Moves selection down by page size (10 items by default).
    - `PAGEUP` - Moves selection up by page size (10 items by default).
    - `HOME` - If focus is in the ComboBox, moves cursor at the beginning of text. If focus is in the picker, selects the first item.
    - `END` - If focus is in the ComboBox, moves cursor at the end of text. If focus is in the picker, selects the last item.
