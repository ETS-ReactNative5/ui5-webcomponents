    refactor(ui5-input): refactor RTL in DatePicker, Menu, (Multi)ComboBox,  RadioButton, Select, SegBtn, TabContainer and Token(izer) components - part 5 (#5162)
    
    Reactor RTL styles with CSS Logical props. The change affects:
    
    Topic B
    DatePicker
    Menu
    SegmentedButton
    Topic P
    Select
    BarcodeScannerDialog
    Topic RD
    TabContainer
    RadioButton
    Topic RL
    MessageStrip
    (Multi)ComboBox, Token, Tokenizer,
    TableColumn, TableGroup
    the BarcodeScannerDialog does not need to set dir anymore as it depends on the Dialog and the DIalog haw been refactored already.
    the MessageStrip has been refactored previously, but the dir has not been removed from the template.
