    fix(ui5-avatar): fix XS size (#2582)
    
    With the introduce of the AvatarGroup the XS size of the Avatar has been broken. Due to the following css the XS size appeared 3rem X 3rem, instead of 2rem X 2rem (as it is by spec). The "XS" styles define min-height and min-width, but the default styles make it 3rem by 3rem.
