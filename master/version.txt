    fix(ui5-date-picker): adjust initial value formatting (#4967)
    
    Problem description:
    When a value string is provided initial with incorrect
    format patter, then this value gets cleared in the on
    before rendering hook.
    Solution:
    The initial value remains unchanged if the internal formatter
    isn't able to parse it.
    
    Fixes: #4958
    Closes: #4958
