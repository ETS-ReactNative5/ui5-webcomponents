    feat(ui5-table): extend keyboard handling (#4550)
    
    This change adds support to `ui5-table` for the following keystrokes:
    
    - `TAB` - If entering for the first time, focus now moves to the first visible item. The item checkbox in MultiSelect mode is now excluded from the tab chain.
    - `F7` - If focus is on an interactive control inside an item, moves focus to the corresponding item.
    - `CTRL`+`A` - Selects all items, if MultiSelect mode is enabled.
    - `ALT`+`UP`/`DOWN` - Moves focus between header, last focused item, and More button in either direction.
    - `PAGEUP`/`PAGEDOWN` - Moves focus up/down by page size (20 items by default).
