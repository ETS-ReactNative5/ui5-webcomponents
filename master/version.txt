    fix(ui5-shellbar): remove unnecessary aria-label from buttons (#3981)
    
    The ui5-button component used inside ui5-shellbar have both aria-label and title set with the same value. This may lead to double announcement
    and trigger warrning by test tools. With this change we remove the aria-label attribute from the ui5-buttons.
    
    Fixes: #3953
