    fix(ui5-input): inner input padding is correctly updated (#3015)
    
    Prevously, after padding: 0 was applied when the condition is false, it remained 0. That could be easily reproduced with native HTML as well. Setting 'undefined' as a value does not change the padding to the one specified in the component's css styles.

    Now, when the padding should not be 0, the inline style is removed, instead of setting 'undefined' as a value
