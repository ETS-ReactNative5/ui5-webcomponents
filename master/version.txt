    feat(ui5-table): add growing on scroll (#2593)
    
    Adds growing capability to the Table upon user scroll (previously possible through "More" button - see the PR #2589). With this feature, the "load-more" event will be fired when the user scrolls to the table's end.
    
    FIXES: #2570
    
    BREAKING_CHANGES: "has-more" removed, use "growing" instead; "load-more-text" has been renamed to more-text; "load-more-subtext" has been renamed to "more-subtext"
