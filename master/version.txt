    refactor(ui5-bar, ui5-badge, ui5-button, ui5-checkbox, ui5-label,  ui5-message-strip, ui5-li, ui5-li-tree, ui5-notification-li): make use of CSS Logical props (#5074)
    
    ### **Background**
    **We no longer need to support IE.** We plan to remove IE specific code, including specific CSS styles. Another important aspect, which is the goal of this PR, is the ability to **make use of the CSS Logical props to implement RTL** (at least for majority of the use-cases) without need of direction detection and setting the "dir='rtl'" attribute into the ShadowDOM.
    Thus, using native browser capabilities and improving the rendering performance (especially in lists with many items) by reducing the calculation of the effective direction.
    ### **Plan**
    **We will roll out our plans to refactor all current RTL styles, however this PR aims to verify the approach, to serve as an example and give rough idea how the CSS logical props can be incorporated. Moreover, we will need to start using them for new RTL implementation.**
