    fix(ui5-select): selection change with keyboard (#3704)
    
    Checks inside onkeydown handler were not enough and _handleKeyboardNavigation method is called event when the tab key is pressed. Executing _handleKeyboardNavigation method when the tab key is pressed leads to change of the selection because event.key returns "tab" which is added to the string that determinates which item should be selected.
    
    _handleKeyboardNavigation is handled on keypress event which is fired when only symbol key is pressed.
