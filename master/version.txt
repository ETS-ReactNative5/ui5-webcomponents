    fix(ui5-dialog): fix text selection on chrome (#3532)
    
    On Chrome, clicking on slotted elements (light DOM) in the
    dialog (shadow DOM) causes the focus to travel up the light DOM tree to
    reach the closes element that is focusable.
    Which ends to be the body element as document.activeElement.
    
    This is not the case for FF & Safari, where the focus travels up the
    slot, reaching the dialog root which is actually the closest focusable element.
    
    This change introduces a workaround to align the focus behaviour in Chrome
    with the other browsers.

    Fixes #3466
