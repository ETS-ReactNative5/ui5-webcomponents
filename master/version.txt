    refactor(ui5-card-header): rename "headerInteractive" to "interactive" (#3562)
    
    As we extracted all header related properties from the Card component to a new CardHeader and the "headerInteractive" property now belongs to CardHeader component, we no longer have to use "header" in the name, but call it just "interactive" - same as we did with the "header-click" event, that is now called "click".
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: The CardHeader's property "headerInteractive" has been renamed to "interactive"
