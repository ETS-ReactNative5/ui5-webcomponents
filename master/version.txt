    refactor(ui5-messagestrip): update icons for better contrast ratio (#3288)
    
    This is to full-fill global requirement of the VD team. It turns out that the currently used message/value state icons do not cover the contrast ratio criteria. The change replaces the icons in the MessageStrip component with the recommended icons.
    
    Fixes: #3287
