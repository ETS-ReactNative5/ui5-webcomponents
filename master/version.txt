    fix(ui5-input): remove the 'submit' event (#2855)
    
    The 'submit' event fired from the ui5-input component is now removed as it is an event of the 'form' element and not of the input ones. From now on, the submit (event) must be triggered manually when enter key is pressed.
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: the 'submit' event is now removed. The 'submit' functionality must be added with a custom code - listen for the standard "keydown" event and check if ENTER is pressed to submit a form, containing the input component.
