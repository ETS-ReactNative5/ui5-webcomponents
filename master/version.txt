    fix(ui5-list): remove busy indicator dom (#2712)
    
    Follow up of #2684 where the placement of the busy has been fixed. With this change we make sure the busy ind DOM is not even rendered when the List is not busy. And, aims to fix the issue with components such as the ComboBox, Select and Input, that uses the List internally, would display additional space after the last list item.
