    fix(ui5-switch): adjust focus outline (#4665)
    
    * fix(ui5-switch): focus outline adjustment
    
    The ui5-switch component focus outline is drawn
    with the help of a pseudo element. This pseudo
    element is displayed bigger than the actual
    ui5-switch root element. As a result the focus
    outline could get cut off.
