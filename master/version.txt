    fix(ui5-shellbar): fire "click" by the correct abstract ui5-shellbar-item (#4303)
    
    - Fix an issue with the following code, although no longer throws an error as before the recently introduced [fix](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/pull/4287/files) is not complete:
    
    ```js
    const refItemId = event.target.getAttribute("data-ui5-external-action-item-id");
    const shellbarItem = this.items.find(item => {
            return this.shadowRoot.querySelector(`#${refItemId}`);
    });
    ```
    
    As this is always true (the clicked item is among all items):
    ```js
            return this.shadowRoot.querySelector(`#${refItemId}`);
    ```
    the result will be always the same - the first ui5-shellbar-item in the array will be returned and the"click" event will be always fired by the first ui5-shellbar-item, although we might click on another custom icon within the bar - the 2nd, 3rd, etc.
    
    - Add a test to avoid degradations
