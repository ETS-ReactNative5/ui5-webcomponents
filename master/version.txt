    fix(ui5-li-custom): removed height restriction (#4473)
    
    * fix(ui5-li-custom): removed height restriction
    
    CustomListItem is no longer restricted to a hardcoded height. Now it
    aligns its height depending on its content.
    
    fixes: #4450
    
    * now the CLI has minimum height set to the LI base height
