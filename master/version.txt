    fix(ui5-input): fix Backspace on Input type=Number (#2864)
    
    Issue: If you remove/delete a number/character in Input type="Number" with Backspace and you click somewhere else, e.g. focus out, the deleted number/character gets back into the input field.
    Root cause: The "_handleInput" handler works with event from type "InputEvent" that never has "key" or "keyCode", that's why "isBackspace" or any other checks regarding pressed keys will always result in false.
    Solution: The solution is to execute the logic on keydown where the "KeyboardEvent" has "key" or "keyCode", store the result and later use it in "_handleInput".
    
    FIXES: #2841
