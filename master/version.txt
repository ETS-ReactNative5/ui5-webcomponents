    feat(ui5-combobox): add suggestions grouping (#3469)
    
    Enable users to set items to groups. Groups are visually identified in the suggestions list by group headers.
    For group headers a new component is introduced - ComboBoxGroupItem. The grouping is based on the items order as they are declared in the markup - the items between two group headers are considered to belong to the first one.
    
    Fixes: #3371
