    refactor(ui5-illustrated-message): convert SVG files to JS imports (#3556)
    
    Since all SVG and JS imports were pre-generated it was hard to keep everything up to date and synced correctly.
    Now, the single source of truth are the SVG files of each illustrations and all JS imports are automatically generated when the build is started.
