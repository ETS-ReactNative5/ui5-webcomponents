    fix(ui5-calendar): fix displayed month name (#5212)
    
    The core handling of the CLDR data and CLDR data itsef is correct.
    The root cause seems to be the usage of getMonths in the MonthPicker. Exchanging it with getMonthsStandAlone resolves the issue. This is the method used in the OpenUI5 equivalent.
