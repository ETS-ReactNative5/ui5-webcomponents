    feat: add and update icons from 4.13 and 5.01 icon fonts  (#4790)
    
    ### Background
    SFSF has requested a missing icon ("bookmark-2") that they would need in 3 weeks for their 2205 release.
    The icon has been implemented and part of the latest icon font editions since end of January.
    The change adds the requested icon + several more new icons that are missing and adopts all updates in the latest 4.13 (v4) and 5.01 (v5) icon fonts.
    
    ###  Update existing v4  and v5 icons to latest
    - adopt icon font version 4.13 for SAP Quartz (shows too many changes because spaces have been turned to tabs)
    - adopt icon font version 5.01 for SAP Horizon
    
    ### New icons
    - e293; icon-heart
    - e294; icon-heart-2
    - e296; icon-bookmark-2
    - e297; icon-detail-less
    - e298; icon-detail-more
    - e299; icon-flag-2
    - e29a; icon-folder-2
    - e29b; icon-paint-bucket
