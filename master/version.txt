    refactor(ui5-timeline-item): rename API (#3387)
    
    Improve naming as part of #3107. The word item is obsolete in the props/event names as the component is TimelineItem and has the word item itself.
    
    BREAKING_CHANGE: The properties `itemName` and `itemNameClickable` are renamed to renamed to `name` and `nameClickable` and the event `item-name-click` is renamed to `name-click`
