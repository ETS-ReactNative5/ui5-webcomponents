    feat(ui5-view-settings-dialog): add more event.details to confirm/cancel events (#4772)
    
    The confirm event now contains two more fields:
    sortByItem selected item (reference to element)
    sortDescending Boolean result for SortOrder (if is true - Descending order is selected)
    
    Fixes: #4539
