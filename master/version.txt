    docs: describe formSupport slot (#2909)
    
    When some of the components such as FileUploader, Checkbox, Select are used with "name" attribute and FormSupport is enabled, the insertion of the native input with slot="formSupport" throws t warnings as the slot is unknown to component's metadata.
    Minor fix: when the Select has no options, the code that tries to get the value from the selected option used to fail.
    
    FIXES: #2902
