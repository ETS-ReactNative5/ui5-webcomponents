    fix(ui5-multi-input): improve backspace and home handling (#4646)
    
    The focus on `backspace` now moves to the last token if the cursor is at the beginning of the input.
    When `home` is pressed and the cursor is at the beginning, focus now moves to the first token.
    Also fixes the _itemNavigation error log.
