    feat(icons): use icon name as default module export (#5207)
    
    We now use the icon name string as default export. This will allow developers to directly set the imported icon name string
    to the Icon component (as shown below) improving the DEV experience:
    easier to determine (within the IDE) if imported icons are still used in the module
    immediate feedback (within the IDE) when import is missing for an icon that is actually used
    
    FIXES: #5122
