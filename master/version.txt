    fix(ui5-view-settings-dialog): adjust scrollbar behavior  (#4795)
    
    Problem description:
    The ui5-dialog's content could have a redundant
    horizontal scrollbar on Safari and Firefox when
    there is a vertical scrollbar placed as an overlay.
    Solution:
    A right margin is applied to the ui5-view-settings-dialog
    content and ui5-date-picker content.
