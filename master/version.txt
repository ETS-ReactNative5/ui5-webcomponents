    fix(ui5-icon): work of applied styles (#2872)
    
    Issue: Processed CSS code for IE11 makes selectors too strong and developers are not able to change the display CSS property with CSS class. The selector (ui5-icon:not([hidden])) 1 has 10 points for pseudo element and 1 points for the tag name which results in 11 points.
    Solution: Rework selectors to make them weaker - 10 points.
    
    Fixes: #2839
