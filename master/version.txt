    fix(ui5-daterange-picker): month is not changed when select first datâ€¦ (#3255)
    
    Until now, when the user navigates to a month in the future or in the past, and the first date of the range is
    selected, the picker goes back to the current month. Now this is fixed - on a date click the month stays unchanged.
    
    Fixes #3129
