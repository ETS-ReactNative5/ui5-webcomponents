    feat(ui5-side-navigation): add "header" slot (#2520)
    
    Provide API, header slot, displayed in the top-most area of the SideNavigation component to enable users adding additional information, usually profile/user data, avatar, etc.
    Also includes a minor fix (min-width: 3rem;) that prevents the SideNavigation (when collapsed) from shrinking due to resize.
    
    FIXES #2518
