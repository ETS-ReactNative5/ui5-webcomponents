    fix(ui5-flexible-column-layout): correct columns display (#3444)
    
    Sometimes timeout that adds ui5-fcl-column--hidden is executed when the calculations are already done. Executing the timeout callback later causes visual issue where column is hidden when it should be displayed.
    
    Now, timeout is replace with listener for transionend so if it is no longer needed to be removed.
    
    Fixes: #3425
