    refactor(ui5-notification-action): rename component (#2580)
    
    Based on the feedback that NotificationOverflowAction is not completely matching its purpose and usage, as it can be both displayed within and out of the overflow popover of a notification item. We decided to rename it as follows:
    - rename `NotificationOverflowAction` -> `NotificationAction`
    - rename `ui5-notification-overflow-action` to `ui5-notification-action`
    
    BREAKING_CHANGE If you previously used `ui5-notification-overflow-action` and had the following import statement:
    ```js
    import "@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/NotificationOverflowAction.js";
    ```
    now you have to  use the `ui5-notification-action` tag and import  the following module:
    ```js
    import "@ui5/webcomponents-fiori/dist/NotificationAction.js";
    ```
