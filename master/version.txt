    fix(ui5-popover): Calculate max content height (#3386)
    
    Resolves https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/issues/3131
    
    This fix steps on the following commit: https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/commit/e35cc1ae9f3830fa137b3d683dc10481e13743f4
    It enhances it in a way that Popover.MIN_OFFSET is taken into account into Popover's
    maxContentHeight.
    Popover.MIN_OFFSET is used when calculating the offset of the Popover from the top, but has never been extracted from the content's height.
