    fix(ui5-shellbar): press on custom action throws JS error (#4281)
    
    Pressing on custom action throws JS error
    To reproduce, open the link and click on random ui5-shellbar-item
    https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/master/playground/fiori/pages/ShellBar/
    
    The ShellBarItem used to have template before, but we have recently remove it, and any access to the shadowRoot that previously worked, now resolves to null as the ShellBarItem.
    
    In addition, make the overflow popover open safely by always requiring it explicitly, not relying on a side effect, that other will be called and initialise the popover beforehand.
