    feat(ui5-avatar-group): initial implementation (#2524)
    
    Introduce new component in the main package, called AvatarGroup. The component is used to display a group of avatars arranged horizontally. It is useful to visually showcase a group of related avatars, such as, project team members or employees. The control allows you to display the avatars in different sizes, depending on your use case.
    Supports 2 main types - Group and Individual:
    - Group type: The avatars are displayed as partially overlapped on top of each other and the entire group has one click/tap area.
    - Individual type: The avatars are displayed side-by-side and each avatar has its own click/tap area.
    
    Fixes: #2409
