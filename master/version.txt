    * fix(ui5-illustrated-message): remove offensive characters
    
    Problem:
    There were 'Z' characters in some of the illustrations. They are now
    considered offensive.
    
    Solution:
    'Z' characters are removed from the following illustrations:
    - NoEntries (Spot/Dialog/Scene)
    - NoData (Scene)
    - NoNotifications (Spot/Dialog)
    - TntNoApplications (Spot/Dialog/Scene)
    - TntNoFlows (Spot/Dialog/Scene)
    - TntNoUsers (Spot/Dialog/Scene)
    
    * More illustrations are now politically correct:
    - EmptyCalendar
    - SimpleBell
    - SleepingBell
    - Tent
    
    * fixed incorrect SVG ID
