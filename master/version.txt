    feat(ui5-button): add new `tooltip` property (#4737)
    
    Problem description:
    The ui5-button tooltip text was supplied trough the
    private "title" property. As result the same title
    attribute was placed to the ui5-button element and
    to the inner native button element, which was causing
    duplicate tooltip announcements.
    
    Solution:
    New public "tooltip" property is added, which results
    in placing "tooltip" attribute to the ui5-button element
    and a "title" attribute to the inner native button element.
    
    Fixes: #4689
