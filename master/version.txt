    fix(ui5-input): Fix value reset on ESC (#3886)
    
    Now the component is synced with the desired by specifications behavior.
    If the suggestions popover is opened: ESC closes it.
    If the suggestions are not opened: ESC resets the value to the last confirmed by the user with 'ENTER' or if there isn't one - with the initial value of the component when focused by the user.
    
    Fixes #3784
    Closes #3784
