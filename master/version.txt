    feat: add SAP-icons5.0 (#4244)
    
    The change adds a new set of icons, based on the newly introduced **SAP-Icons5.0 font** as part of the existing **"icons" package**. The goal is to display the new icons only in Fiori Next sap_horizon theme and keep using the old icons for the rest of the themes.
    Components and applications will keep using the current icon imports and the framework will detect the theme and render the corresponding icon from SAP-icons4.0 for Fiori 3, and SAP-icons5.0 for Fiori Next. No changes are required neither by the component developers, nor by the app developers - **backward compatible icon imports.**
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: The icons SVG imports are changed. If you previously had
    ```js
    import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/accept.svg";
    ```
     you have to import the SVGs from the **v4/**  or the **v5/** directory:
    ```js
    import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/v4/accept.svg"; //  for SAPIcons4.0
    import "@ui5/webcomponents-icons/dist/v5/accept.svg"; // for SAPIcons5.0
    ```
