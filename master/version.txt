    test: fix failing test on mac (#2814)
    
    - DateRangePicker test is using CTRL-A to reset
    the state from the previous test.
    - This fails on mac, so a quick fix is to
    reopen the page to get a clean state.
    - A follow-up fix will use a separate component so that tests do not
    depend on the state of the previous test
