    refactor(ui5-card): header slot is added (#3490)
    
    Extract the Card's header part as a separate component with all the related API, called CardHeader and introduce new slot "header" in the Card.
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: titleText, subtitleText, status, headerInteractive properties, action and avatar slots, and header-click events are not available anymore. Instead, use the newly created CardHeader component, where all these properties are available ("headerInteractive" becomes "interactive" and "header-click" becomes "click"). In addition, the Card now has a "header" slot, for which you can use the CardHeader.
