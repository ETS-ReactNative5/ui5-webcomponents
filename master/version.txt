    fix(ui5-link): add `noopener` to rel attribute (#4533)
    
    - The "noopener" text is added to the rel value attribute alongside "noreferrer" text for compatibility reasons with the openui5's sap.m.Link implementation.
    - Explicit specification of rel "noopener" helps protect users from tabnabbing in legacy browsers including Edge Legacy and Internet Explorer.
