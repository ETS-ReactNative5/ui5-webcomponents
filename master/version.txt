    refactor(ui5-message-strip): rename tag name (#4268)
    
    Change tag name to ui5-message-strip to be consistent with components that may come in future, such as ui5-message-popover, ui5-message-dialog, ui5-message-*.
    Thanks to the altTag metadata entry, the old tag will still work, not to break consumers immediately, and later-on we can remove the altTag as well.
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: MessageStrip component's tag name has been renamed from ui5-messagestrip to ui5-message-strip.
