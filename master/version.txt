    feat(ui5-li-notification*): full-fill accessibility spec (#2578)
    
    We identified gaps in the accessibility implementation, that this change aims to address as follows:
    **NotificationListItem**
    - More Button: added aria-label="More"
    - Close Button: added aria-label="Close"
    **NotificationListGroupItem**
    - Invisible text reading: added "read" or "unread", based on the "read" property.
    - Root: added aria-expanded="true"/"false", based on the "collapsed" property
    - More Button: added aria-label="More"
    - Close Button: added aria-label="Close All"
    - Toggle Button added title="Collapse Group" ("Expand Group") and aria-label="Collapse Group" ("Expand Group") - based on the "collapsed" property
    **NotificationListGroupItem**
    - new property "read" (previously available in the NotificationListItem only)
