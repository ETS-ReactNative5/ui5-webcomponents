    feat(ui5-tabcontainer): implement sap_horizon theme (#4079)
    
    The change implements one of the three suggested designs in Fiori Next Figma Alpha design, the one that is closest to the current design (Note: There is single parameter extraction in CheckBox - you can skip that part).
    
    Note:
    pressed state - not implemented as would require additional JS
    disabled state - not implemented as would required new API
    
    Fixes: #4045
