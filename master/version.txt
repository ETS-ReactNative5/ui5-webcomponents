    fix(ui5-wizard): remove unneeded aria properties (#4262)
    
    - Remove accessible-name on Wizard level as it is unneeded, the region has a default aria-label and the wizard itself should be used along with a page with title.
    - Remove accessible-name and accessible-name-ref from Wizard Step, as it does not work and also again not needed. The wizard step title is used as a label of the element.
    
    BREAKING CHANGE: accessible-name has been removed
