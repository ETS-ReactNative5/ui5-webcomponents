    fix(ui5-date-picker): remove timezone test (#4829)
    
    - The DateFormat's parse method wasn't expected
    to call getDate on the already correctly parsed
    JavaScript Date object. The result is declared
    invalid and replaced with null when the day doen't
    match the one from the string. The timezone test
    is removed as we don't have a way to mock the JS Date.
