    feat(ui5-page): Initial implementation (#2685)
    
    The component has the following features:
    - slots for header, content (should be put in the middle) and footer
    - property to make it scrollable or not scrollable
    - both the header and footer are visible while scrolling the content
    - floatingFooter - property to support "floating footer"- the footer should not take space, but the page should add more padding to the scrolling content, so that when scrolling to the very bottom of the content the content does not underlay the footer.
    - hideFooter
    
    FIXES: #2433
