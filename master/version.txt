    fix(ui5-calendar): re-render header on lang change (#2939)
    
    The CalendarHeader is not language aware, because unlike the Calendar, DatePicker and the rest Date* components, the CalendarHeader is not derived by DateComponentBase class (which is language aware) and thus never re-renders on language change, triggered by the setLanguage API - the week days get translated, but the month text in the CalendarHeader - not.
