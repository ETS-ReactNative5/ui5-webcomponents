    fix(ui5-calendar): keyboard navigation in the picker grid now works properly (#2532)
    
    * fix(ui5-calendar): keyboard navigation works properly after date deselection
    
    Deselecting a date, when ui5-calendar selection type is "Multiple",
    now doesn't cause keyboard navigation in the grid to stop working.
