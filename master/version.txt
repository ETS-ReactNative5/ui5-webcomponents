    refactor(ui5-tabcontainer): deprecate tabsPlacement (#3338)
    
    Hide the tabsPlacement, but keep it working for some time as it is consumed in production, until we introduce the feature on stakeholder's side. Part of: #3107
    
    BREAKING_CHANGE: tabsPlacement has been removed as it is not specified in SAP Fiori 3 design system
