    * fix(ui5-switch): adjust additional description announcements
    
    Problem description:
    An additional description provided trough the
    "accessible-name-ref" attribute wasn't announced by
    the screen reader.
    
    Solution:
    The text for "on" or "off" state is now moved
    from aria-labelledby attribute to the "aria-label"
    attribute along with the additional description
    provided by the user.
    
    Fixes: #4887
