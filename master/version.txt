    feat(framework): support sap-* config URL params (#3138)
    
    The change will assist broader UI technology co-existence by allowing the app developers use the older sap-* params in order to configure the theme, language, etc. There are use-cases where the sap-* is still the preferred param.
    In case both sap-ui-* and sap-* params are set, the sap-ui-* ones will take precedence - the same way UI5 handles it.
    
    FIXES: #3114
