    fix(ui5-dialog): fix content stretching on Safari (#3068)
    
    On Safari the style that stretches the content flex: 1 1 auto is not working the same way as in the rest of the browsers. Two issues have been observed:
    (1) One with the Wizard, the navigation header used to not remain at the top, but scrolled together with the content, which breaks the scrolling/navigation of the Wizard
    (2) One of the Dialog itself - the header and the footer are not displayed correctly (see below), because of the content not stretched correctly. Adding "height: 100%", when the "stretched" property is set did fix the issues.
    
    FIXES: #3064
