    fix(ui5-radiobutton): fix tab order within group (#2783)
    
    We used to set tabindex="0" to the selected item and tabindex="-1" to the rest, which works fine in all cases, besides the one reported in the issue - when the application wants to define a group without preselected item. In this case, all the radio buttons in the group have tabindex="-1" and as a result the group is not accessible via the keyboard.
    Now, we calculate the tabindex for each item on every important action, such as: selection of item within the group, creating a new group, adding an item to the group or removal an item from the group. The logic considers the use-case from the issue as well - If the group does not have a selected item, the first (not disabled) item would have tabindex="0".
    In openui5, this is handled by the sap.m.RadioButtonGroup control, here it is implemented within the RadioButtonGroup util class.
