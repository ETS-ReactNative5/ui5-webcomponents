    fix(ui5-icon): fix click event fired twice (#2858)
    
    We used to fire a custom event, but did not stop the native one and end up with firing two "click" events.
    Now, the native one is stopped properly (we need to fire the custom one, so the noConflict ui5-click is also fired). Also, one additional fix has been performed - the content no longer scrolls when the SPACE key is pressed over "interactive" icon.
