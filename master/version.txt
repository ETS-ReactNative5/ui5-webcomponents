    feat(ui5-date-picker): component is now aligned with the specification (#2304)
    
    Focus handling is aligned with the KBH specification:
    
    When an year is selected from the year picker the day picker is shown and focus
    is set to the last selected date or to the current date.
    When a month is selected from the month picker the day picker is shown and focus
    is set to the last selected date or to the current date.
    When month picker is opened the focus is set to the selected month or to the current month
    if there are no selected dates.
    When year picker is opened the focus is set to the selected year or to the current year
    if there are no selected dates.
    Selection is applied in compliance with the UX specification, when a picker is opened:
    
    Calendar items from the month picker and year picker are not rendered selected, when there are no
    selected dates.
    Fixes #2151
