    fix(ui5-input): Consistent "change" event (#4129)
    
    * fix(ui5-input): Consistent "change" event
    
    The change event was not fired consistently in different scenarios. This change tries to fix that, so only a new value would trigger a henge event.
    
    There are some "edge" cases like:
    - Selecting an item from suggestions should trigger change event imediately, if the value actually changed
    - Hitting Enter should trigger change event imediately, if the value actually changed
    - Focusing out should trigger change event, if the value actually changed. BUT should not trigger it if Enter was pressed before that.
