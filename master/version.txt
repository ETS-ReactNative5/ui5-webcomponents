    fix(ui5-list): focus after element when TAB key is pressed (#3220)
    
    If the "More" growing button is currently focused and the TAB key is pressed, focus is returning to the last focused ui5-li in the same list (focus trap). The focus is now moved to the next interactive element after the ui5-list, when TAB key is pressed.
