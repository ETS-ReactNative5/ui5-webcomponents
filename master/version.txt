    feat(ui5-dialog): labeling of header slots is now possible (#3155)
    
    When Dialog's header slot is used, developers now would be able to use newly added accessible-name attribute to label the dialog properly. (If the header slot is not used, the Dialog labels the internally created header as previous.)
    
    Fixes: #2838
