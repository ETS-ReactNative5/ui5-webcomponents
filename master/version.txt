    feat(ui5-segmented-button-item): introduce new component to serve as child of SegmentedButton (#3258)
    
    Introduce new component SegmentedButtonItem (ui5-segmentedbutton-item), meant to be used within the SegmentedButton (ui5-segmented-button) as a child, in order to implement a11y compliant DOM structure and attributes. The SegmentedButtonItem replaces the ToggleButton, previously used in the SegmentedButton.
    
    Fixes: #3191
    Closes: #3191
    
    BREAKING_CHANGE: `selectedButton` event detail of "selection-change" has been renamed to `selectedItem`
    BREAKING_CHANGE: SegmentedButton no longer accepts ToggleButton, you have to use the newly created component, called SegmentedButtonItem as follows:
    <ui5-segmentedbutton>
       <ui5-segmentedbutton-item pressed>One</ui5-segmentedbutton-item>
       <ui5-segmentedbutton-item>Two</ui5-segmentedbutton-item>
       <ui5-segmentedbutton-item>Three</ui5-segmentedbutton-item>
    </ui5-segmentedbutton>
