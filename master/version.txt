    fix(ui5-avatar): fix click event fired twice (#2967)
    
    We used to fire a custom event, but did not stop the native one and end up firing two "click" events.
    Now, the native one is stopped properly (we need to fire the custom one, so the noConflict ui5-click is also fired).
    FIXES: #2943
