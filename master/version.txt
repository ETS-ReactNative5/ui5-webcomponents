    fix(ui5-tabcontainer): await for renderFinished in resize handler (#4675)
    
    The issue occurs in a case where TabContainer's handleResize gets
    called before onAfterRendering. At that point, TabContainer hasn't
    rendered its own representation of the tabs (stripPresentation)
    which it later relies on.
    
    Part of #4628
