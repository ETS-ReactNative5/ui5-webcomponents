    feat(ui5-shellbar): introduce accessibilityTexts property (#4377)
    
    New property from type Object, called accessibilityTexts is introduced to allow customization of some internal parts of the ShellBar web component via stable API. Currently the only thing available on the object is the profileButtonTitle to define the profile button tooltip, showing up on hover.
    
    Fixes: #4009
