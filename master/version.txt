    fix(ui5-wizard): observe content height changes (#2801)
    
    Issue: When the step content size is changed runtime, step selection might go wrong as the steps' scroll positions are out of sync - the wizard works with the old ones.
    Solution: Observe steps and update state to store steps' scroll positions.
